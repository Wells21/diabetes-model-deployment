**Project Overview**

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project aims to build a machine-learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a dataset containing various medical and lifestyle features.

**Data Collection**

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

*Blood Glucose*, *Gender*, *Age*, *BMI*, *hypertension*, *heart disease*, *diabetes (Target Variable)*

**Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing steps included:

* Handling missing values.
* Scaling numerical features.
* Encoding categorical variables.

**Feature Selection**

Feature selection was performed using:

* Correlation analysis.
* Feature importance from tree-based models.

**Model Building**

Several machine learning algorithms were experimented with, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests

The final model was chosen based on its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Model Evaluation**

The model was evaluated using:

* Performance on a hold-out test set
   
**Deployment**

The model was deployed as a web application using Flask. The app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting health data and receiving diabetes risk predictions.

**Challenges**

Some of the challenges faced during the project were:

* Balancing the dataset to handle class imbalances.
* Ensuring model interpretability for healthcare professionals.
   
**Future Work**

Future enhancements for the project include:

* Integrating the model with electronic health records (EHR) systems.
* Continuously improving the model with more data and feedback from healthcare practitioners.
